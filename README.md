## Picobot
Recreation of [picobot](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/picobot/). This version works the same as tradional picobot. However, entering programs is significantly more difficult in the desmos version, as you have to write your programs using a list of constants. It currently has a maze solving program inputed, but it could be programmed to do anything. Click cells on the maze to toggle whether they are active or inactive.

## Epicycle Visualizer
Epicycles were an old way of describing planetary movements in the Hipparchian, Ptolemaic, and Copernican systems of astronomy. They feautred a series of spinning circles, which given enough of circles could approximate any movement. However, they fell out of favor due to the discovery that orbits were elliptical. That being said they are still cool to look at! If you want to change the way the wheels work, change/add numbers to the wheels and speeds lists.

## Dragon Fractal Generator
Creates a representation of the dragon fractal in desmos. This was one of my first projects and I have since learned a bunch of new techniques, but it is still pretty interesting. Click the tick button a bunch of times until you get an error message about list sizes.
